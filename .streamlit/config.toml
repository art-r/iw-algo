# Level of logging for Streamlit's internal logger: "error", "warning",
# "info", or "debug".
# Default: "info"
level = "info"

[client]

# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions and deprecation warnings
# are displayed in the browser. This can be one of the following:
# - "full"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays app deprecation
#                  warnings and exceptions, including exception types,
#                  exception messages, and associated tracebacks.
# - "stacktrace" : In the browser, Streamlit displays exceptions,
#                  including exception types, generic exception messages,
#                  and associated tracebacks. Deprecation warnings and
#                  full exception messages will only print to the
#                  console.
# - "type"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays exception types and
#                  generic exception messages. Deprecation warnings, full
#                  exception messages, and associated tracebacks only
#                  print to the console.
# - "none"       : In the browser, Streamlit displays generic exception
#                  messages. Deprecation warnings, full exception
#                  messages, associated tracebacks, and exception types
#                  will only print to the console.
# - True         : This is deprecated. Streamlit displays "full"
#                  error details.
# - False        : This is deprecated. Streamlit displays "stacktrace"
#                  error details.
# Default: "full"

# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu,
# and settings dialog (top right of the app).
# Allowed values:
# - "auto"      : Show the developer options if the app is accessed through
#                 localhost or through Streamlit Community Cloud as a developer.
#                 Hide them otherwise.
# - "developer" : Show the developer options.
# - "viewer"    : Hide the developer options.
# - "minimal"   : Show only options set externally (e.g. through
#                 Streamlit Community Cloud) or through st.set_page_config.
#                 If there are no options left, hide the menu.
# Default: "auto"

# Controls whether to display the default sidebar page navigation in a
# multi-page app. This only applies when app's pages are defined by the
# `pages/` directory.
# Default: true

# Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true

# Handle script rerun requests immediately, rather than waiting for script
# execution to reach a yield point. This makes Streamlit much more
# responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in
# apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state
# assignment statements.
# Default: true
fastReruns = true

# Raise an exception after adding unserializable data to Session State.
# Some execution environments may require serializing all data in Session
# State, so it may be useful to detect incompatibility during development,
# or when the execution environment will stop supporting it in the future.
# Default: false
enforceSerializableSessionState = false

# Adjust how certain 'options' widgets like radio, selectbox, and
# multiselect coerce Enum members when the Enum class gets re-defined
# during a script re-run. For more information, check out the docs:
# https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/design/custom-classes#enums
# Allowed values:
# - "off"          : Disables Enum coercion.
# - "nameOnly"     : Enum classes can be coerced if their member names match.
# - "nameAndValue" : Enum classes can be coerced if their member names AND
#                    member values match.
# Default: "nameOnly"
